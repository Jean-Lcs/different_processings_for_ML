# different_processings_for_ML

![Cover](https://github.com/Jean-Lcs/different_processings_for_ML/blob/main/ML_dimension.png)

In this project, we use differents methods to transform our dataset (usually dimension modification) before making prediction thanks to machine learning and regressions.
Those methods are:
  - Nothing: No modification
  - PCA : We keep as much as variance as possible within two columns
  - Regularisation: With a Lasso regretion, we deduce the alpha value
  - Variable selection: We keep only columns that contain the more variance

Finally, we compare the results to see which one is truly efficient
